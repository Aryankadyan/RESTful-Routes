# RESTful-Routes

<h1>🌐 RESTful Routes Guide</h1>
A simple and organized project demonstrating RESTful routing conventions for building clean and scalable APIs.

<h2>📚 What are RESTful Routes?</h2>
RESTful Routes are a set of conventions for defining endpoints in a web server that map HTTP methods to CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

<h3>🚀 Features</h3>
🔥 RESTful Endpoints following best practices.
🛠 CRUD Operations for resource management.
🧩 Express.js Integration for simplicity and scalability.
📖 Well-documented route structure.

<h3>🛠 Technologies Used</h3>
Node.js – JavaScript runtime.
Express.js – Web framework for Node.js.
Postman (optional) – API testing tool.

<h3>🗂 RESTful Route Table</h3>
Assuming a resource named posts:
<br>
    <h4>
HTTP Method  |   Route  	 |      Description	        |    CRUD Operation </h4>

GET	         |  /posts	   |   Retrieve all posts	    |      Read
<br>
GET	         | /posts/:id	 |  Retrieve a single post	|      Read  
<br>
POST	       | /posts	     |  Create a new post	      |    Create
<br>
PUT	         | /posts/:id	 |  Update an existing post |    	Update 
<br>
DELETE	     | /posts/:id	 |  Delete a post	          |    Delete
